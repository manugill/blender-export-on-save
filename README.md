# blender-export-on-save
A basic blender addon to automatically export files on save in Blender.
Currently only has options for GLB export.

## Usage
In the Scene Properties is a sub-menu, "Export on Save", which currently has "GLB Export". Press this and export to enable automatic exporting whenever you save. Be sure to save the export settings.
To disable auto-exporting, delete "gltf_filepath" in Custom Properties.
It's a janky setup, but it's good enough for me.
